		<h2>A Table Summarizing All Traditional Machine Learning Methods</h2>

		Wouldn't it be cool if you could have <b>ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION about TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING models in one page?</b> 
		I have created a <a href="summaryMLModels.pdf">table</a> which compiles high level details of some traditional machine learning models. 
		Specifically the table discusses different <b>classification and clustering models</b>. 
		For each model I discuss many feartures like the <b>model space, search function and score function</b>.  
		The purpose is to provide a cheatsheat for experienced machine learning folks and <b>NOT to teach these methods</b>. 
		The table is created using the material I learnt during the 
		<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/courses/CS57300.html">CS-573 Data Mining</a> course at Purdue. 
		Please shoot me an email if you find errors in the slide or need some clarification.
